## Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft created a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

> **Students**, Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/jg2gax8pzd6o81?WT.mc_id=academic-4621-cxa) and by watching the videos mentioned below.

## Pedagogy

Authors of the materials have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building the curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a typing game, a virtual terrarium, a 'green' browser extension, a 'space invaders' type game, and a business-type banking app, and will have learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer. 

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. There are also several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with video from the "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript?WT.mc_id=cxaall-4621-cxall)" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12 week cycle.

While we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks so as to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: "[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs?WT.mc_id=cxaall-4621-cxall)".
