## CSS Refactoring

### Instructions

Restyle the terrarium using either Flexbox or CSS Grid, and take screenshots to show that you have tested it on several browsers.
You might need to change the markup so create a new version of the app with the art in place for your refactor. Don't worry about making the elements draggable; only refactor the HTML and CSS for now.
