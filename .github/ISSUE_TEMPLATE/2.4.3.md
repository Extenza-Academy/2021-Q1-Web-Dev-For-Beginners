There are other ways of looping over arrays other than for and while loops. There are [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach), [for-of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), and [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). Rewrite your array loop using one of these techniques.
