# Terrarium Project Part 1: Introduction to HTML

## ðŸš€Challenge

There are some wild 'older' tags in HTML that are still fun to play with, though you shouldn't use deprecated tags such as [these tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Obsolete_and_deprecated_elements) in your markup. Still, can you use the old `<marquee>` tag to make the h1 title scroll horizontally? (if you do, don't forget to remove it afterwards)
