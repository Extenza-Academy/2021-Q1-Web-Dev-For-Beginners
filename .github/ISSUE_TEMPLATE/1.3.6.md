## Analyze a non-accessible web site

### Instructions

Identify a web site that you believe is NOT accessible, and create an action plan to improve its accessibility. Your first task would be to identify this site, detail the ways that you think it is inaccessible without using analytic tools, and then put it through a Lighthouse analysis. Take the results of this analysis and outline a detailed plan with a minimum of ten points showing how the site could be improved.
